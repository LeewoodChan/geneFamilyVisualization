Make Figures
+ Flowchart of exon layout decision process

Exon Layout Module:
+ Code algorithm to output exon connection data
  * Process the exons by alignment position, creating new visual columns as needed
+ Develop test scenarios
+ Test output against test scenarios
  * Add functionality for user-specified Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)?

Visualization Module:
+ If there's no exon for 1+ genes, move the box down
+ Have a floating legend with the gene names and colors
+ Boxes within the same gene should never overlap (push everything to the right)
+ Tooltip for visual exons:
  * Gene name and exon # (e.g., gene ABC123, exon 3; gene XYZ789, exon 7)
  * Multiple Sequence Alignment subset
+ Make sure the image works for web, articles and poster paper
+ Develop test scenarios
+ Test output against test scenarios
