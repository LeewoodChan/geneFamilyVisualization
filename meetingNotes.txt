20160830 Meeting
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background & Motivation:
---------------------------------
Alpha-fetoproteinRelatedGeneARGANewMemberOfTheAlbuminGeneFamilyThatIsNoLongerFunctionalInPrimates.pdf
EvolutionaryAnalysisOfTheMammalianM1AminopeptidasesRevealsConservedExonStructureAndGeneDeath.pdf
Research Statement

Tasks / Timelines:
---------------------------------
Understand the processing pipeline
Develop test cases based on FirstSTEP project results
Add documentation [comments] to the existing code
Modularize the code
Install necessary packages to run the code

Basic Layout:
+ If there's no exon for 1+ genes, move the exon box down
+ Boxes with the same gene should never overlap (push everything to the right)
+ "When the lines cross over, things can get visually messy, is it possible to maybe make the exon blocks slightly bigger, the colored lines thicker, and put more visual space between each of the lines? If you had thicker lines, and more negative space, I think it would be easier to keep track of them."
+ Make sure the output/image works for web, scientific articles and poster-sized paper
+ Verify supporting browsers / OSes
+ More sure "lines should never touch exons that aren't matching"
+ Additional output formats (so that the "output file be something editable by the authors")
+ Calculated pairwise similarities and determine the layout based on either the most similar first or last

Interactive:
+ Tooltip for boxes: Gene name and exon # (e.g., gene ABC123, exon 3; gene XYZ789, exon 7)
+ Color the exon sizes in the boxes the same color as the gene it's referencing
+ Show % sequence identity shared among two gene exons along with shared exon lengths
+ Verify supporting browsers / OSes
+ Add interactive option to display the alignment for each exon
+ Select which genes to include


20160915 Team Meeting
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Meeting Agenda:
---------------------------------
Demo of working dataParsing.cgi
+ Debugging options
+ Provide necessary files (via github [in the examples directory])

To-Dos:
-----------
Test cases / examples
+ Reformat FirstSTEP 2014's files for input to dataParsing.cgi (Dr. C)
+ Look at FirstSTEP 2014's files

Fix / Rewrite backend code
+ Expand dataParsing.cgi to work with command-line arguments [Ethan]
  import os
  if 'GATEWAY_INTERFACE' in os.environ:
      fileItems = form['filename[]']
  else:
      fileItems = sys.argv
+ Get a SIMPLE python cgi script to produce a SIMPLE webpage (moot point)
  * Apply to dataParsing.cgi (done!)
  
If you're sending a question to Dr. C via slack.com, then either 1) send it directly to him or 2) use @channel [which will include everyone] (so that Dr. C will get an email)

Reporting protocols
+ Email by Thursday 11:00 AM with:
  * Progress for the week
  * Roadblocks
  * Plans for the next week
  * Hours worked

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Agenda:
---------------------------------
Status reports (see also last meeting's to-dos)
+ Ethan reported about using <div>s instead of .svg files
Git tutorial
+ Working model
  * Create newFile.txt
  * git add newFile.txt  # adds newFile.txt to your staging area
  * git commit -m "message"  # updates newFile.txt in your local repository
  * git pull  # get updates from the remote repository
    - Handle any conflicts

Agenda:
---------------------------------
Status reports (see also last meeting's to-dos)
+ Leewood: Q: Command-line args ready to merge into master branch? A: Yes

Added Tasks / Timelines in 20160830 entry above
+ Need to add: Remove "pseudo linear" (additional) horizontal spacing

To-dos:
+ Ethan: Make simple .svg file with a mouseover windows with links in the window
+ Leewood: Merge addArg branch into master branch & changing the STDOUT to be the html (instead of writing it to a file)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agenda:
---------------------------------
Dr. Carroll: Summary of call with Dr. Seipelt-Thiemann:
  Exons can have lowercase and uppercase nucleotides in them.  Lowercase nucleotides are part of the untranslated region (UTR).   Dr. Seipelt-Thiemann colored the circles grey for the exons with ONLY untranslated nucleotides.  With an exon has some UTR, then don't align it to other exons.
  Additionally, exons that do share the same reading frame (and start within n residues of each other), but do not have significant (biologically meaniful) similarity, should not be visually represented in the same exon shape.
  Exon boundaries are at most 9-12 nucleotides within each other


he visualizer interface needs to know the exon
addNode(exon_id, MSA_column, readingFrame {0-3}, node_color = None )
addGeneFamily( name, list of exon_ids)


parser -> visualizer interface:
json: 3D array;
1st index:
1) 2D array of exon properties:
   Foreach exon, list it's id, MSA_column, readingFrame {0-3}, node_color = None
2) 2D ragged array:
   Foreach gene, it's name and list of exon_ids
